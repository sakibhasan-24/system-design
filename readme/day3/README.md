# 📘 UML (Unified Modeling Language)

## What is UML?

**UML (Unified Modeling Language)** what is UML?
UML (Unified Modeling Language) is a visual way to design and understand software systems.
Just like a **blueprint** for a building a project.

## Why Use UML?

- 🔹 Visualize software architecture and design
- 🔹 Improve communication between developers, designers, and stakeholders
- 🔹 Detect design issues early
- 🔹 Serve as long-term documentation for the system

## 📂 UML Diagram Categories

UML diagrams are grouped into two main categories:

### 🏗️ Structure Diagrams — _What exists in the system_

| Diagram Type           | Description                                                       |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Class Diagram**      | Represents classes, attributes, methods, and relationships        |
| **Object Diagram**     | Snapshot of instances (objects) and their relationships           |
| **Component Diagram**  | Shows software components/modules and their dependencies          |
| **Deployment Diagram** | Illustrates how software is deployed on hardware (servers, nodes) |

---

### 🔄 Behavior Diagrams — _How the system behaves over time_

| Diagram Type         | Description                                                       |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Use Case Diagram** | Shows system functionality from a user's perspective              |
| **Sequence Diagram** | Visualizes the order of interactions between system components    |
| **Activity Diagram** | Represents workflows and logic sequences                          |
| **State Diagram**    | Displays states of an object and transitions between those states |

## 📌 Simple Example: Use Case Diagram for an programming-Language App

```plaintext
         +------------+
         |   Language |
         +------------+
               |
   +--------------------------+
   |                          |
(readabiity)      (Maintainability)
                         |
                  (Performance)
                         |

```

         +------------------+
         |   Programming    |
         |      Language    |
         +------------------+

```

```
