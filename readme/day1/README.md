## Recap: OOP Concepts – Encapsulation & Abstraction

This section provides a recap of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts, specifically focusing on **Encapsulation** and **Abstraction**. These are foundational ideas you should understand before starting System Design.

### 🛡️ Encapsulation

Encapsulation is the process of **hiding an object's internal state** and requiring all interaction to be performed through an object's methods.

#### ✅ Key Points:

- Wraps **data (variables)** and **methods (functions)** inside a class.
- Makes fields `private` and provides `public` methods (getters/setters) to access or update them.
- Helps in protecting data and maintaining object integrity.

### 🛡️ Abstraction

Abstraction is the concept of **simplifying complex systems** by modeling classes based on the essential properties and behaviors an object should have, while hiding unnecessary details.

#### ✅ Key Points:

- Focuses on **what an object does** rather than how it does it.
- Allows you to define a class with abstract methods that must be implemented by derived classes.
- Helps in reducing complexity by hiding implementation details.
